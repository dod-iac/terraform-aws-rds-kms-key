/**
 * ## Usage
 *
 * Creates a KMS key used to encrypt data-at-rest stored in CloudWatch Logs
 *
 * ```hcl
 * module "rds_kms_key" {
 *   source = "dod-iac/rds-kms-key/aws"
 *
 *   name = "alias/name"
 *
 *   tags = {
 *     Application = var.application
 *     Environment = var.environment
 *     Automation  = "Terraform"
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
  *
 * ## Testing
 *
 * Run all terratest tests using the `terratest` script.  If using `aws-vault`, you could use `aws-vault exec $AWS_PROFILE -- terratest`.  The `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION` environment variable is required by the tests.  Use `TT_SKIP_DESTROY=1` to not destroy the infrastructure created during the tests.  Use `TT_VERBOSE=1` to log all tests as they are run.  The go test command can be executed directly, too.
 *
 * ## Terraform Version
 *
 * Terraform 1.0. Pin module version to ~> 1.0.0 . Submit pull-requests to master branch.
 *
 * Previous versions not supported or use at your own risk.
